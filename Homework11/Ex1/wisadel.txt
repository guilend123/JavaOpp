if you wanna make quick cash then short term trades on a volatile stock is good
set limit orders
you buy it at 100 bucks, sell if it goes below 99, or sell when it hits 101
something like that
like nvidia has been really good for that. it fluctuates around 110-120 now so just buy every time it dips below 110 
and then sell it when its like 115 or 120
keep doing that
